Class Methods => A class methods is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class.
Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator, followed by a function definition.


Class Methods as Alternative Constructors => A class method belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class. One common use case for class methods as alternative constructors is when you want to create an object from data that is stored in a different format, such as a string or a dictionary.
