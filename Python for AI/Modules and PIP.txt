What is a Modules?
Modules is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our python program.
There are two types of modules in python:
1) Built in Modules => These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. No need to install such modules.
2) External Modules => These modules are imported from the third party file or can be installed using a package manager lke pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else , we can install different version of a same module with time.
