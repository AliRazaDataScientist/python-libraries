Static Methods => Static methods in Python are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and do not have to the instance of the class(i.e. self).

Class Math: 
     @staticmethod
     def add(a,b):
	return a+b

result = Math.add(1,2)
print(result)
