Functions => A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

There are two type of functions

User-defined Functions => we will declare it with the keyword of def and then function name

Built-in Functions => Interpreter defined function that we only use like len(), int(), input() etc.

we can use variable as an arguments in functions.We can call it as pass parameters via function call 

There are 4 types of functions:
Default Arguments
Keyword Arguments
Variable Arguments
Required Arguments

Default Arguments => We can provide value while creating function. If function is call and arguments is empty then automatically these arguments are used by default.

Keyword Arguments => We can call the function with keywords without the any order sequence.

Required Arguments => If we didn't give the value as default arguments then it will become required arguments and without arguments calling function is throwing error so that why it is required.

Variable Arguments => We will use ** in the variable arguments and how much arguments is there don't care and we will get it on runtime.
