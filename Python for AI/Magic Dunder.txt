Magic methods, also known as dunders from the double underscore surrounding their names, are powerful tools that allow you to customize the behaviour of your classes.

__init__ method => The init method is special method that is automatically invoked when you are new instance of a class.This method is responsible for setting up the object's initial state, and it is where you would typically define any instance variables that you need.Also called 'constructor'.

__str__ and __repr__ methods => The str and repr methods are both used to convert an object to a string representation. The str method is used when you want to print out an object, while the repr method is used when you want to get a strnig representation of an object that can be to recreate the object.

__call__ methods => The call method is used to make an object callable, meaning that you can pass it as a parameter to a funciton and it will be executed when the function is called.This is an incredibly powerful tool that allows you to create objects that behave like functions.
