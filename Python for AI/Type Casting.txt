TypeCasting => Conversion of one data type to another data type is called typecasting.

Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict(), etc.

Two type of typecasting:
Explicit Conversion
Implicit Conversion

1):Explicit Typecasting:The conversion of one data type into another datatype done via developer or programmer's as per the requirement is known as explicit typecasting.
We can do this via built in functions.


2):Implicit Typecasting:The conversion of one data type to another datatype by the python interpreter itself(automatically).
Python convert a smaller datatype to a higher datatype to prevent data loss.
